              name: this is used on the back end when you submit the form; it
                becomes the key in the params dictionary
              value: this is the default value of the input. not necessary but
                helpful for speeding up demos

              The <br>s between each label/input combo are a quick and easy way
              to put each one on its own line. They aren't necessary for the
              form to function but they help the flow without needing a lot of
              nested <div>s to achieve the desired layout

          This app predicts whether a political news article on the 2016 US election is real or fake.
        </p>
        <p>
          The model was trained on ~70,000 news articles from 3 separate labeled sources (University of Virginia, 
          University of Tennesse, and Kaggle). While a definite time period is ambigiuous across most of the sources,
          the topic of the articles are primarily around the 2016 US election.
